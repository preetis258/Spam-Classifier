# Spam Classifier

This project uses Random Forest Classifier for classifying whether a mail/SMS is spam or not. It uses a dataset containing spam and ham texts.\
Several techniques are used for processing the textual data.\
TF-IDF is used for vectorizing the data and then several Machine Learning models are trained of which Random Forest Classifier performed the best. The metric used for evaluation is Precision. The aim is to maximize Precision score.\
Streamlit library is used and the app is deployed on Heroku cloud.\
